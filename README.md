E-Mess Turbo Repo Starter

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps, Packages and Tools

- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by `web` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
pnpx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
pnpx turbo link
```

### When it's time to add a new package

To add a new package, simply run `pnpm turbo gen` init in the monorepo root. This will prompt you for a package name as well as if you want to install any dependencies to the new package (of course you can also do this yourself later).

The generator sets up the `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and a `index.ts`, as well as configures all the necessary configurations for tooling around your package such as formatting, linting and typechecking. When the package is created, you're ready to go build out the package.
