## Introduction

[⏪ Rewinds](https://rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com) is a web app starter kit with mainly Remix and Tailwind CSS. Visit the demo at [rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com](https://rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com).

The goal is to be as productive as possible to ship things fast. So it is a highly opinionated collection of software engineering and web development workflow, interactive UI components, functionality hooks and utilities.

This template can still be used as is and quite stable, but will not be updated often anymore. See the latest continuation of this starter as [🦌 Antelapp](https://github.com/haidar-dev/antelapp) that also use [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com).

Follow the progress on [GitHub @mhaidarhanif](https://github.com/mhaidarhanif) and [Twitter @mhaidarhanif](https://twitter.com/mhaidarhanif).

## Goals

Use this to build any web apps:

- Personal Website
- Company Profile
- Interactive Form
- Todo List
- Blog or News
- Social Media
- Community Forum
- Support Desk
- Art Gallery
- Job Board
- Hiring or Recruitment
- Applicant Tracking System (ATS)
- Inventory Management
- Events Management
- Knowledge Management
- Admin Panel or Dashboard
- E-Commerce or Storefront
- Product or Project Management
- Content Management System (CMS)
- Learning Management System (LMS)

## Tech Stack

### Primary Tech Stack

The main prerequisites to learn, understand, and use with the stack.

1. [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org): typed language
2. [React](https://react.dev): UI library
3. [Remix](https://remix.run): web framework
4. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): styling
5. [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com): interactive components
6. [Prisma](https://prisma.io): database ORM
7. [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com): database management system
8. [Vercel](https://vercel.com): deployment

If you work as a team, I recommend to:

1. Use [Doppler](https://doppler.com) or [Dotenv](https://dotenv.org) as secrets management platform to share the environment variables. So you can optionally use `.env` file. If you need to share quickly [EnvShare](https://envshare.dev) is good.
2. Use [Vercel Pro](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/payments-and-billing/pro) to make code review with preview deployments easier.

(Architecture diagram can help later on here)

### More Details

This repo is kind of over-engineered to have high flexibility and cover a lot of use cases for different applications/projects/products, especially what I'm working with several other people.

The components are using [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) as the base components style. And the setup for full stack app development is mostly inspired by [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg). The main difference is this repo example uses Remix by default, not Next.js like those two.

## Development

### Install Dependencies

Before running your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed using your preferred package manager agent:

```sh
npm install
yarn install
pnpm install
```

Or if using [`ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni) which can autodetect the agent:

```sh
pnpm add -g @antfu/ni  # Install once globally
ni                     # Will auto choose npm/yarn/pnpm
```

### Setup Environment Variables/Secrets

These are the main environment variables you need to set up on your own for developing locally:

- `DATABASE_URL`
  - Used with Prisma ORM. Get it from local database or [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/connection-strings)
- `UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY`
  - Used with Uploadcare's file uploader widget. Get it from [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com/docs/start/settings)

To manage the environment variables, you can either use:

1. Plain `.env` file
2. Secrets management platform such as Doppler

#### If using `.env` fie

```sh
cp -i .env.example .env
# -i or --interactive will ask before overwrite
```

Then edit `.env` as you need.

#### If using secrets management platform

Alternatively, it's recommended to use [Doppler](https://doppler.com), or
[Dotenv](https://dotenv.org), or something similar to manage the credentials. Especially if you're working with a team.

```sh
doppler login
doppler setup
```

To use the secrets directly:

```sh
doppler -- pnpm <command>
```

To download the secrets into the `.env` file:

```sh
doppler secrets download --no-file --format env > .env
```

> ⚠️ Make sure to setup the environment variables/secrets here, on Vercel, or on your preferred deployment target. Otherwise the app will break on production. That's why a secrets management platform is recommended to manage them easily. There are also some preset strings in the `.env.example` which you can copy directly.

### Prisma ORM and Database Connection

It's up to you which database/DBMS you want to use with the app that supported by Prisma ORM. This repo is suited to use either your own MySQL instance or MySQL on PlanetScale. But don't use SQLite because it doesn't have `@db.Text` annotation and `model.createMany()` function.

Once you have the database URL connection string from PlanetScale MySQL instance, for example:

#### If using PlanetScale

1. [Create a PlanetScale account](https://planetscale.com) which you can [sign up for free](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up).
2. [Create a database](https://planetscale.com/docs) and get the database URL connection string as `DATABASE_URL` from there.
3. Put the `DATABASE_URL` to the environment variables.

```sh
DATABASE_URL='mysql://username:pscale_pw_password@region.connect.psdb.cloud/name?sslaccept=strict'
```

#### If using local database

Run Docker service and run [Docker Compose script](./docker-compose.yml):

```sh
docker compose up
```

While in development, you can:

- Generate Prisma types for `@prisma/client` with `nr prisma:generate` (it runs `prisma generate`)
- Check generated Prisma documentation with `nr docs:prisma` (it runs `prisma-docs-generator serve`) then open <http://localhost:5858>
- Visualize the schema with [Prisma Editor](https://github.com/mohammed-bahumaish/prisma-editor) or [Prismaliser](https://prismaliser.app)
- Push Prisma schema changes for PlanetScale with `nr prisma:push` (it runs `prisma db push`)
  - Notice that with [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/prisma-quickstart) approach with [Prisma](https://prisma.io/docs/guides/database/using-prisma-with-planetscale), we don't need migration files in our repo, but rather managed in their platform.
- Read the [official Prisma docs](https://prisma.io/docs) and [How to Prisma](https://howtoprisma.com)
  - Follow the [PlanetScale & Prisma happy practices](https://planetscale.com/docs/prisma/prisma-best-practices)
  - Can also try [PrismaGPT](https://gpt.howtoprisma.com) to help learn the query.

### File upload with Uploadcare

This repo using [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com) to primarily upload and host the uploaded images and files. If you want the upload component to run, you need to paste your [Public API key](https://uploadcare.com/docs/start/settings/#keys-public) to `UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY` env var.

1. [Create an Uploadcare account](https://uploadcare.com).
2. Go to the Dashboard and get the public key string.
3. Put it as `UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY` to the environment variables.

### Run Development Server

Make sure you've generated the latest Prisma schema with `nr prisma:generate`.

Afterward, start the Remix development server like so based on your preference:

- Run without HMR: `nr dev`
- Run with HMR: `nr dev-hmr`

Without HMR, it will just run `remix dev`, the Remix server on development. Then wait until you see this:

```sh
Loading environment variables from .env
Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000
```

Open up <http://localhost:3000> and you should be ready to go!

Alternatively, you can enable/disable HMR by changing this in the `remix.config.js`. By default we're not using it.

```js
const isUsingHMR = false;
```

With HMR, it will run both `dev:remix` and `dev:express`, the Remix server and the Express server with HMR enabled. Then wait until you see this:

```sh
📀 Remix on Express server port :3000
Loading environment variables from .env
💿 Built in 0s
```

Open up <http://localhost:3000> and you should be ready to go!

### TypeScript and ESLint Server

When you update some significant changes in the TypeScript config, ESLint config, or just generated a new Prisma schema, you can restart the language server as needed:

```sh
> TypeScript: Restart TS Server
> ESLint: Restart ESLint Server
> Prisma: Restart Language Server
```

### Customize some contents

Look up for these comments:

- `EDITME`: You can edit them based on your need
- `TODO`: You can see that they are in progress

## Deployment

### Vercel

As this repo was made after having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed. Alternatively you can just use the "Deploy to Vercel" button above.

Just keep in mind to set up the environment variables/secret that preferably differentiated for each server environments such as local/development, staging/preview, and production.

Required for the app to run:

```sh
# Primary database that connects to Prisma ORM
DATABASE_URL=

# Session secret for cookie after authenticated or logged in
REMIX_SESSION_SECRET=

# Application name
REMIX_APP_NAME=

# Application transactional email
REMIX_APP_EMAIL=

# Upload image assets solution
UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY=
```

The session secret for `REMIX_SESSION_SECRET` can be generated more securely using either Node.js crypto module (JS) or OpenSSL (shell):

```sh
$ node scripts/generate-secret.js
1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890

$ sh scripts/generate-secret.sh
yjudrrKv/W4jxzmQqXze9T7DEANxStDtg4YCdfgs/4E=
```

When managing environment variables/secrets using Doppler, there's the auto sync integration to Vercel:

- <https://doppler.com/integrations/vercel>
- <https://vercel.com/integrations/doppler>

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
ni -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

To make it automatic for Vercel CI to push the database schema changes (especially to PlanetScale) while building for Preview and Production, you can setup the build command to use the `build:ci` script instead of regular `build`.

Put this into the Build Command in the Project Settings:

```sh
pnpm build:ci
```

(Change `pnpm` to your package manager of choice)

## Important Notes

### Tailwind CSS Config

Use [uicolors.app](https://uicolors.app/create) or [tints.dev](https://tints.dev) to generate the color tokens easily. Then replace what's inside `tailwind.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: {
          50: "#f2f9fd",
          // ...
          950: "#0c1c27",
        },
        surface: {
          50: "#f4f8f9",
          // ...
          950: "#040506",
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Remix Entry Files

This repo already has the entry files. Since Remix `v1.14`, you might notice that the entry files might be able to be implicitly defined. At the moment, I still suggest revealing or explicitly defining them to make it work smoothly.

```sh
npx remix reveal
```

### Remix SEO Configuration

As there's no official way yet to handle SEO related output for metadata and sitemap, here are the options ordered by preference:

1. [`balavishnuvj/remix-seo`](https://github.com/balavishnuvj/remix-seo): Collection of SEO utilities like sitemap, robots.txt, etc. for a Remix Application
2. [`chaance/remix-seo`](https://github.com/chaance/remix-seo): A package for easily managing SEO meta and link tags in Remix
3. [`fedeya/remix-sitemap`](https://github.com/fedeya/remix-sitemap): Sitemap generator for Remix applications

### Database backup

Syntax to backup using PlanetScale's `pscale` CLI:

```sh
pscale db dump database_name branch --output database_name.dump
```

For example:

```sh
pscale db dump rewinds main --output rewinds.dump
```
